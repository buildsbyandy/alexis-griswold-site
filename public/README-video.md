# Background Video Setup

To complete the video background feature, add your background video file to this directory:

- **File name**: `background-video.mp4`
- **Location**: `/public/background-video.mp4`

## Video Requirements:
- Format: MP4 (recommended for web compatibility)
- Resolution: 1920x1080 or higher for best quality
- Duration: 10-30 seconds (will loop automatically)
- File size: Keep under 10MB for optimal loading

## Fallback:
The video will use `/test_1.JPG` as a poster image while loading.

## Alternative:
If you don't have a video file yet, the component will gracefully fall back to the poster image.
